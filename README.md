## Project Name
**Wesal – Organized Transportation System**

---

## Project Description
Wesal is a technology-based transportation system designed for recurring,
planned commuting. The platform operates through fixed subscriptions,
predefined routes, and scheduled times, providing a stable and reliable
alternative to on-demand transportation.

Instead of requesting a ride for every trip, users subscribe to an organized
transportation plan that ensures consistency, reliability, and advance planning.

## Problem & Solution

### The Problem
Most existing transportation services rely on on-demand ride requests, which
are not suitable for users who depend on recurring and regular commuting.
This model often leads to unstable availability, inconsistent schedules,
unpredictable costs, and daily stress caused by repeated booking.

### The Solution
Wesal replaces on-demand transportation with a subscription-based system
built on advance planning. By offering fixed routes, scheduled commute times,
and transparent pricing, the platform ensures consistent availability,
schedule reliability, and a more stable transportation experience.
